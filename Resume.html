US Citizen, Ph.D. Computer Science<br>

<p>My overall objective is to improve large software systems through the
development of novel techniques as well as the application of known
engineering principles.  I am a proven technical leader, who likes to grapple 
with hard engineering
problems that most people assume are impossible to solve.  I enjoy leading by
example and getting my hands dirty.  I have worked in many spaces, including
things as diverse as low level machine code optimization, compiler 
optimization, programming language design, IDE features, built the <a 
href="https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/">Swift 
Playgrounds iPad app</a>, and ran a team at Tesla applying a diverse range 
of tech in the autonomous car space (including machine learning, computer
vision, sensors and non-vision perception, robotics planning and control, mapping, cloud infrastructure, embedded systems, and simulation).</p> 


<p>I am the founder and chief architect of the open source <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM Compiler 
Infrastructure project</a>, and serve on the board of directors of the LLVM Foundation.
LLVM has
grown to include a broad range of compiler, debugger, and runtime library
technologies.  Assembled out of this technology are things like the <a
href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang compiler</a>, the <a
href="http://lldb.llvm.org">LLDB debugger</a>, the <a 
href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/">Clang Static Analyzer</a>, and
other low-level tools.
LLVM is widely used for <a href="http://llvm.org/pubs/">academic research 
projects</a>, has been adopted for <a 
href="http://llvm.org/Users.html">commercial use by several companies</a>,
and has a broad and growing 
developer base.  For more information, please see the LLVM web 
page: <a href="http://llvm.org">http://llvm.org/</a>.</p>

<p>I am also the founder and project lead for the <a 
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift Programming 
Language</a>, which is open source at <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift.org</a> and <a 
href="https://github.com/apple/swift">GitHub</a>.  Swift has been steadily and rapidly
growing ever since its launch, with over 100,000 apps in the Apple app stores,
is installed on millions of developer workstations, and is widely loved by people who use it.
Since its release as open source, Swift is rapidly growing in the server space and in
other domains outside of the traditional Apple developer community.
</p>

<p>I am a strong leader and have excellent communication skills (both 
verbal and written).  I occasionally give talks explaining and evangelizing 
Swift, LLVM, Clang, and other technologies I have worked on.</p>

<li>
<b>Senior Director, TensorFlow TPU and Technologies</b><br>
August 2017 - current

<p>
The TensorFlow team is an incredibly dynamic and fast moving team, incorporating multiple cross-cutting concerns that I love to work on and with.  This includes complex product issues, Open Source infrastructure, deep technical challenges, new hardware platforms, and a race with the rest of the industry.  At the time of this writing (September 2018) I'm driving three main projects:

<ul>

<li><p><b>TensorFlow TPU engineering:</b> My primary responsibility is driving TensorFlow support for "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_processing_unit">Tensor Processing Units</a>" (aka TPUs) forward.  TPUs are a critical Google investment into custom hardware and software for Machine Learning training and inference and can deliver &gt; 100 petaflops of compute in <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/09/google_tpu_3/">a single (large) system</a>.  TPUs are widely used internally are available to the public as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/">Google Cloud TPUs</a>.  This is a highly cross-functional project - our team drives TensorFlow Software support (e.g. Python APIs, XLA integration etc), commercial success of Cloud TPUs through high-end customer engagements, drive key internal teams to success, and collaborates with scientists across the greater Google AI team to bring their innovations to the market.  Sales, marketing, and other similar functions are owned by the Google Cloud team, and XLA is owned by the hardware organization.
</p></li>

<li><p><b>Swift for TensorFlow:</b> <a href="http://github.com/tensorflow/swift">Swift for TensorFlow</a> rethinks machine learning development by opening the programming language to extension and change - allowing us to solve old problems in new ways.  This project includes a combination of compiler, runtime, and programming language design and implementation work.  I imagined, advocated for, coded the initial prototype and many of the subsystems after that; recruited, hired and trained an exceptional engineering team; we drove it to an open source <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yze693W4MaU">launch</a> and are continuing to build out and iterate on infrastructure.  We are now intentionally maintaining a low profile as we are building out infrastructure, but aim to start pushing for it in the first half of 2019.  If you'd like to participate or follow along, please join our <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/swift">community</a>.</p></li>


<li><p><b>New Compiler Infrastructure for Machine Learning:</b>
I am driving a (currently stealth mode) project to build key compiler and runtime infrastructure underlying TensorFlow and its support for a very wide range of high performance accelerators.  This project is driven by the increased generality of new hardware and programming models, as well as the need to enable rapid bringup of new hardware - sometimes with wildly different capabilities and target markets.  This is a large scale project pushing the boundaries of fundamental compiler technology - we are aware of and build on key concepts from existing systems, but are innovating in all areas of compiler architecture and design.  We expect to announce and open-source this project when the time is right.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>Incidentally, I'm actively hiring a for a large number of engineer, manager, and tech lead positions (up to Director / Principle Engineer level) for the above projects - if you are experienced and interested, please get in touch with me.

<li>
<b>VP Autopilot Software</b><br>
January 30 - June 20, 2017

<p>
When I joined Tesla, it was in the midst of a hardware transition from 
"Hardware 1" Autopilot (based primarily on MobileEye for vision processing) 
to "Hardware 2", which uses an in-house designed TeslaVision stack.  The 
team was facing many tough challenges given the nature of the transition.  
My primary contributions over these fast five months were:</p>

<ul>
<li>We evolved Autopilot for HW2 from its <a href="https://electrek.co/2017/01/21/tesla-first-phase-enhanced-autopilot/">first early release</a> (which had few 
capabilities and was limited to 45mph on highways) to effectively parity with HW1, and 
surpassing it in some ways (e.g. <a 
href="https://electrek.co/2017/05/21/tesla-autopilot-update-elon-musk/">silky 
smooth control</a>).</li>

<li>This required building and shipping numerous features for HW2, including: <a href="https://electrek.co/2017/02/15/tesla-autopilot-autosteer-local-roads-enhanced-autopilot/">support for local roads</a>, <a href="https://electrek.co/2017/02/23/tesla-enhanced-autopilot-autopark-parallel-parking/">Parallel Autopark</a>, <a href="https://electrek.co/2017/03/29/tesla-8-1-software-update-improves-autopilot-2-autosteer-summon/">High Speed Autosteer, Summon, Lane Departure Warning, Automatic Lane Change</a>, <a href="https://electrek.co/2017/04/26/tesla-automatic-emergency-braking-autopilot-architecture/">Low Speed AEB</a>, <a href="https://electrek.co/2017/05/06/tesla-autopilot-update-removing-autosteer-restriction/">Full Speed Autosteer, Pedal Misapplication Mitigation, Auto High Beams, Side Collision Avoidance</a>, <a href="https://electrek.co/2017/06/10/tesla-autopilot-update-smooth-autopark/">Full Speed AEB, Perpendicular Autopark, and 'silky smooth' performance</a>.</li>

<li>This was done by shipping a total of 7 major feature releases, as well as 
numerous minor releases to support factory, service, and other narrow 
markets.</li>

<li>One of Tesla's huge advantages in the autonomous driving space is that it 
has tens of thousands of cars already on the road.  We built infrastructure to take 
advantage of this, allowing the collection of <a 
href="https://electrek.co/2017/05/06/tesla-data-sharing-policy-collecting-video-self-driving/">image and video data</a> from this fleet, as well as building <a href="https://electrek.co/2017/06/14/tesla-autopilot-data-floodgates/">big data infrastructure</a> in the cloud to process and use it.</li>

<li>I defined and drove the feature roadmap, drove the technical architecture
for future features, and managed the implementation for the 
next exciting features to come.</li>

<li>I advocated for and drove a major rewrite of the deep net 
architecture in the vision stack, leading to significantly better precision, 
recall, and inference performance.</li>

<li>I ended up growing the Autopilot Software team by over 50%.  I personally interviewed most of the accepted candidates.</li>

<li>I improved internal infrastructure and processes that I 
cannot go into detail about.</li>

<li>I was closely involved with others in the broader Autopilot program, 
including future hardware support, legal, homologation, regulatory, 
marketing, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Overall I learned a lot, worked hard, met a lot of great people, and 
had a lot of fun.  I'm still a firm believer in Tesla, its mission, and the 
exceptional Autopilot team: I wish them well.
</p>

<h3><a name="Apple">Apple</a></h3>

<ul>

<li>Apple: Developer Tools Department<br>
<b>Senior Director and Architect, Developer Tools Department</b><br>
January 2013 - January 2017

<p>In January 2013, I took over management and leadership of the entire Developer
Tools department at Apple (~200 people).  In addition to languages (Swift
and Objective-C), compilers and low-level tools, I took on responsibility for the 
Xcode IDE, Instruments performance analysis tool, Apple Java releases, and a 
variety of internal tools.<p>

<p>In this time period, my team shipped a number of major Xcode releases, including Xcode 4.6, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x, each with major feature enhancements.  
Some of my more notable contributions include:</p>

<ul>
<li>ARM64: Over a 3 year span, I drove definition, bringup and implementation 
work of the ARM64 (aka Aarch64) compiler toolchain - the first production quality 
compiler for this architecture in the world - which shipped in Xcode 5.  This 
enabled the iPhone 5s, which shocked the world with its <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A7">64-bit support and superb 
performance</a>.  In addition to 
compiler work, I contributed to the design of a <a
href="https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2013-09-27-arm64-and-you.html">new Objective-C runtime object 
model</a> for the architecture, and I personally contributed
the "TBI" feature to ARM, which was incorporated in the Aarch64 architecture.</li>
<li>iPhone GPU Compiler: we implemented a completely new LLVM-based runtime GPU 
shader compiler. This started shipping in iOS7 to support the iPhone 5s - which 
featured a VLIW <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerVR#Series_6_.28Rogue.29">PowerVR Rogue GPU</a> 
derivative, and has been extended to support later iPhone hardware as it comes out.
Compared to the vendor compiler it replaced, this GPU compiler produces code
that runs slightly faster, and takes much less compile time to generate it.</li>
<li>Xcode 5 was a major release, notable for me in that it was the first
release with a completely LLVM-based low-level toolchain (Clang, LLDB, etc) - it 
dropped the last support for GCC and GDB.  This transition 
was largely driven by the ARM64 architecture transition.</li>
<li>Swift: The most prominent feature of Xcode 6 was <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)">Swift</a>, a
new programming language that I had been personally driving since 2010.  In
addition to the language design and implementation, I drove much of the
compiler architecture (e.g. the SIL high-level IR), the REPL and Playgrounds
feature designs, drove and coordinated the rest of the team to implement full
Xcode and documentation support for a language that was still rapidly evolving.
We managed to keep extremely tight secrecy until a great launch at WWDC 2014.</li>
<li>I was the primary proponent for the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/">
Official Swift Blog</a> and wrote many of the posts.</li>
<li>I drove <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift Open Source</a> to happen, and was 
extensively involved defining exactly what that meant.</li>
<li>I was one of the few core people who drove <a href="https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/">Swift Playgrounds for iPad</a>, including conception, 
design, implementation, and iteration.</li>
<li>I was a member of Apple's senior executive leadership team, and drove a number of internal
things that I can't talk about.</li>
</ul><br>
</li>

<li>Apple: Developer Tools Group<br>
<b>Director and Architect, Low-Level Tools</b><br>
September 2011 - January 2013

<p>This timeframe has included numerous technical and team achievements
   across a wide range of domains.  For example:
</p>
   <ul>
   <li>Apple shipped the Mac OS X 10.8 and iOS 6 releases, and they were
   built with Clang - llvm-gcc is obsolete, and GCC is long gone.</li>
   <li>We invested major effort into compiler implementation and tuning for 
   the custom Apple CPU design known as the "<a 
   href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A6">Apple A6</a>".  The
   exceptional CPU performance of the iPhone 5 was a result of a joint effort 
   between the Apple silicon and LLVM teams.</li>
   <li>I personally drove LLDB to production quality and to become the default
   debugger in Xcode.</li>
   <li>I drove the new "<a 
   href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ObjectiveCLiterals.html">Objective-C 
   Literal Syntax</a>" language extensions, making many common
   situations in Objective-C much more syntactically elegant.</li>
   <li>We shipped <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode#4.x_series">Xcode 
   4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 releases</a>, and I was a key part of the high level
   feature planning and decision processes that defined the features and
   shaped the releases.</li>
   </ul><br>
</li>

<li>Apple: Developer Tools Group<br>
<b>Senior Manager and Architect, Low-Level Tools</b><br>
June 2010 - September 2011

<p>I managed the teams responsible for compilers, the LLDB debugger, 
   Objective-C and C++ runtimes, assembler, linker, dynamic loader, etc.  I
   am continuing my work improving the Apple developer tools, and continue to
   contribute daily to the open source LLVM technologies.  During this time
   period my team switched Mac OS/X Lion and iOS5 to build with llvm-gcc and 
   clang (off of GCC 4.2) and oversaw the final release of Xcode 4.0 in March 
   (as well as subsequent updates).</p>
<p>Xcode 4.2 was a specific achievement in that it is the first release where
   all of its compilers are LLVM-based (GCC 4.2 is no longer included).
   Xcode 4.2 also includes the "<a 
   href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AutomaticReferenceCounting.html">Automatic
   Reference Counting</a> (ARC) Objective-C language feature (see also 
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Reference_Counting">wikipedia</a>).  
   ARC has revolutionized Objective-C programming by automating memory
   management without the runtime overhead of a garbage collector.  I personally 
   defined and drove this feature late in the schedule of iOS5 and Lion.  This
   is notable for the short schedule for the project, the extensive
   cross-functional work required, and the extensive backwards compatibility
   issues that had to be addressed (making it a very technically complex
   problem).</p>
</li>

<li>Apple: Developer Tools Group<br>
<b>Senior Manager of Compilers and Low-Level Tools, Compiler Architect</b><br>
September 2009 - June 2010

<p>My work in this time period culminated in the release of the Xcode 4 preview
   at WWDC, which included a preview release of Clang C++ support, a new <a
   href="http://libcxx.llvm.org/">C++ Standard Library</a>, a much faster and
   memory efficient system linker, a <a
   href="http://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/intro-to-llvm-mc-project.html">new X86 
   assembler</a> (which is integrated into the clang compiler, providing faster 
   compile times), and countless smaller improvements throughout the toolchain.</p>

<p>Xcode 4 itself now features deep integration of the Clang parser for code 
   completion, syntax highlighting, indexing, live warning and error messages,
   and the new 'Fix-It' feature in which the compiler informs the UI how to
   automatically corrects small errors.  LLVM-GCC is the default compiler in 
   Xcode 4.</p>

<p>The Xcode 4 preview also includes the first public release of <a
   href="http://lldb.llvm.org">LLDB</a> to which I served as a
   consultant and contributed directly to turning it into an open source
   project.</p>
</li>

<li>Apple: Developer Tools Group<br>
<b>Manager of Compilers and Low-Level Tools, Compiler Architect</b><br>
July 2008 - September 2009

<p>In this time period, I was a second level manager running the teams responsible for
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a>, 
<a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a>, <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a>,
and other parts of the Apple toolchain (assembler, linker, etc).  I directly 
managed the Clang team, contributed daily to both the Clang and LLVM projects, 
and continued in my role as compiler architect and lead on the Open Source 
LLVM/Clang projects.
</p>

<p>During this period my team brought Clang 1.0 to production quality as a
brand new C and Objective-C compiler for X86-32 and X86-64.  We also
productized and shipped the Xcode static analyzer, a new <a
href="http://compiler-rt.llvm.org/">compiler-rt library</a>
(which replaced libgcc in Snow Leopard) and many enhancements to existing
components in the operating system.</p> 

</li>

<li>Apple: Developer Tools Group<br>
<b>LLVM Compiler Group Manager and Compiler Architect</b><br>
December 2006 - July 2008

<p>In this time period, my group expanded use of LLVM within Apple, supported 
new clients, built new features, and extended LLVM in many ways.  
We shipped llvm-gcc 4.2 in the Xcode 3.1 and major improvements for it in the 
Xcode 3.1.1 release.</p>

<p>In addition to llvm-gcc, much of the work during this time was focused on
Mac OS 10.6 development.  I made major contributions to design and
implementation of the <a
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/cfe-dev/2008-August/002670.html"
>"Blocks" language feature</a> as well as to the architecture and design of
the language and compiler aspects of the <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL">OpenCL</a> GPGPU technology.</p>

<p>Finally, during this period I architected and started implementation of a 
suite of front-end technologies based on LLVM, named "<a 
href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang</a>".
</p>

</li>

<li> Apple Computer Inc: Developer Tools Group<br>
<b>Senior Compiler Engineer and Tech Lead</b><br>
June 2005 - December 2006

<p>I drove LLVM productization, features and applications at Apple.
LLVM <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.html">link-time
optimization</a> support is now integrated into the Apple 
system linker, and LLVM is used by the <A
href="http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/llvmdev/2006-August/006492.html">Apple
OpenGL group</a> for several different purposes.  My main contributions during
this time was a new llvm-gcc4 front-end, significant improvements to the X86
and PowerPC backends, a wide range of optimization improvements and new
optimizers, significant improvement to the target-independent code
generator, and leadership for the rest of the team.</p>

<h2><a name="pubs">Writen Work and Publications</a></h2>

<p>Here are some of the more interesting things I've written:</p>

<ul>
<li> In 2011, I wrote <a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/llvm.html">a chapter</a> on LLVM for "<a 
href="http://www.aosabook.org/">The Architecture of Open Source 
Applications</a>," a book on software design.  It explains
traditional compiler design, what makes LLVM different, how
library-based design impacts applicability of the code, and how some simple
optimizations work.</li>
<li>May 2011: I wrote <a href="http://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html">a treatise about undefined behavior in C</a>, describing how it works, why and why it is so problematic.  I wrote this when working on Swift, and because I was tired of explaining the same old problems in C over and over.</li>
</ul>


<p>Since joining industry, I rarely take time to write papers about my 
work, preferring instead to focus on building new great things.  That 
said, LLVM is widely used as a basis for <a 
href="http://llvm.org/pubs/">many current and past research
projects</a> by other people.</p>
