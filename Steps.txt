main symbol is “?” to define variables as an Optional, It means, that can be nil
Forcibly Unwrapping:
You can unwrap your Optional variable with “!” operator but it’s a less safe wrapping way
var moviesCount: Int?

print(moviesCount!)

// Fatal error: Unexpectedly found nil while unwrapping an Optional value

2 - Conditional Unwrapping
You can unwrap your Optional variable with if let statement
var songName: String?

if let songName = songName {
    // it means, if the unwrapped value is not nil
    /*
        WRITE SOMETHING HERE
    */
}
else {
    print("songName is nil")
}

3 - Unwrapping via Type Casting
var userData: Any? = 1

if userData as? String != nil {
    print("userData is defined as a String.")
}
else if userData as? Int != nil {
    print("userData is defined as an Integer.")
}

4 - Implicitly Unwrapping
It means, when defining the variable with exclamation mark then use in somewhere, your variable will be unwrapped automatically

import UIKit

// Forcibly Unwrapping Begin
var name: String? = "Batuhan"

name!

// Forcibly Unwrapping End
// Implicitly Unwrapping Begin
let age: Int! = 20
age

// Implicitly Unwrapping End
